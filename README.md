# Automatic Keycloak Mattermost Id

This is the code of a Keycloak plugin allowing the assignment of a random (long) user id to each user, at account creation (REGISTER event) or at login (LOGIN event).
This eases the interfacing with Mattermost when using Keycloak as a "fake Gitlab", as described on the following websites:

This is experimental, no testing is done, it might kill your pets, â€¦

The code is based on https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/latest/event-listener-sysout/
